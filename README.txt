0. Very Basic Git Settings: 

git config --global user.name <name>
git config --global user.email <email adress>

1. clone a copy of this repository to a directory of your choice using:

git clone /hts/data4/rschwess/Sasquatch_offline/Sasquatch.git <your new directory of your SasQ copy>

2. Edit the Script paths in the desired workflow and pipeline scripts to your local clone

3. Enjoy Playing around and change what you like in your clone. The clone is version controled itself (have a quick read through basic git tutorial for suggestions). 

4. For pulling recent changes in the global repository use: 

git pull origin

5. Familiarize the git version control collaboration structure for submitting or pulling any changes to the global version. (But contact me first ;)! )
